<p style="padding-top: 25px">So the game that I decided to test out and play was the game Inside the Void by 3D Methods. As listed in the description it is “an exploration game where you must navigate through seven alien structures in an effort to unravel the disappearance of lost crew members. You will encounter messages left by the lost crew members that offer a glimpse into their fate.” I found the game to be very interesting and different compared to the games that I am familiar with. The game is known as a “walking” or “exploration” type game. When you first start off in the game you are stuck on an alien planet from some sort of spacecraft. Then it is up to you to wander around and find certain clues and entryways.

I find this game to be perfect for someone who wants to have a laid back exploration type experience. The game does some very calm peaceful music, but the scenery of the game is the one thing that I found to be the most interesting. The colors of the different dimensions you wander through were very vivid and sharp with cool-looking designs in each of the different stages of the game. Throughout the game, there are not any other characters other than you and the aliens who live on the planet. When playing the game you will be walking around the map until you find either a building-shaped portal-looking thing or you find one of the little hubs which tell you what the objective is.

The one problem I have with the game is the last thing I mentioned in that paragraph about the little hubs which are supposed to inform you of what you need to know to complete a task or know where to go. The problem with these is that when you walk up to the most of the time they all say the same message so for a while I feel like I was walking around clicking on those for no reason at all. The majority of my notes were taken on the clarity of the settings of each “level.” Each portal took you somewhere where each time there was a completely different setting and mood. There were brighter levels which gave me more of an energetic mood compared to the more dark levels which are able to scare you in some circumstances.

The different interactions that you face in the game I feel can also be improved. I say the interactions in the game are most of the time sort of boring, but I also need to keep in mind that this game is more for the exploration and mood factor. I feel as an art form this game is straight-up incredible. The game’s visuals are pretty outstanding and caught my attention very easily. I feel this is something missed in games because you are going to be looking at it the entire time you are playing it why would you make it with lame non-standout colors. This is the entire reason this game caught my eye and why I picked this game over all the other games. It was because of how well this game portrayed it’s aspect of different colors that are not usually used in video games too much.

If you are looking to play a fun easy game where you just explore and have fun in cool alien-looking areas this is the game for you. I really like how simple and easy this game really is. I suggest this game to anyone with a computer out there in the world, because I’m sure the colors of this game will shock you just as much as they did to me. This game is definitely worth try at the crazy alien adventure.
