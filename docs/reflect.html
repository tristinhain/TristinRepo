Using GitHub and WordPress in this assignment I have found WordPress to be easier to use compared to GitHub. The one aspect that I found much easier on WordPress was how you are able to type the "visual" text down and have the website do the coding for you. You are then able to just open the text option which will write all the HTML code out for you. In GitHub, you have to enter the HTML code for it to properly go through and work. Another thing that was much more difficult in GitHub is that you need to use GitBash to "pull" and "push" your work through to your local files for them to be seen on your website. With WordPress you are able with a click of a button by just clicking "update" the website will be fully updated.
